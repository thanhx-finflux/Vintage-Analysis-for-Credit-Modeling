# Vintage-Analysis-for-Credit-Modeling
This project is a full Vintage Analysis on LendingClub consumer loan data from Kaggle to understand credit performance across years and loan years.

Vintage analysis is a core technique in credit monitoring, portfolio analytics, and underwriting evaluation.

Building vintage curves
- Cumulative default rate
- Months since loan
- Cohorts: 2012-2018

- The vintage analysis provides insights into how default rates evolve over time for different cohorts of loans, which is valuable for credit risk modeling and understanding loan performance trends.
- From 2011 to 2018, the cumulative default rates for loans issued in each month show a general trend of decreasing default rates. This indicates that Lending Club's loan portfolio has improved in quality over time, likely due to better underwriting practices and risk assessment.
- In 2018, the cumulative default rates were significantly lower compared to previous years. For example, loans issued in 2012 had a cumulative default rate of about 4.02% after 12 months, while loans issued in 2018 had a cumulative default rate of approximately 2.28% after the same period. This suggests that Lending Club has been successful in reducing credit risk in its loan portfolio over the years.

## Key Question Answered
- How do default rates evolve as loans age?
- How do vintages differ in early months with late periods?
- Which years were high-risk, and which saw underwriting improvements?
- How do structural credit changes show up in the vintage curves?
## Key finding

- 2012 - 2014 were strong improvement years
- 2015 -2016 deterioration years
- 2017 was a recovery year
- 2018 was the best performing year (lowest default rates across 12 months)
